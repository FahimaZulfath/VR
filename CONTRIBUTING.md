# Contributing to SOHW

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰ âœ¨

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to TOAST UI. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Reporting Bugs
Bugs are tracked as GitHub [issues](https://github.com/SOHW/sohw.github.io/issues/). When you create an issue, please provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. Don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used a mouse or a keyboard.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.** Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets on the issue, use Markdown code blocks.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.

## First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to SOHW? You can start by looking through these `document`, `good first issue` and `help wanted` issues:

* **document issues**: issues which should be reviewed or improved.
* **good first issues**: issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* **help wanted issues**: issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.


## Fork the Repository

Be sure to add the relevant tests before making the pull request. Docs will be updated automatically when we merge to `master`, but you should also build the docs yourself and make sure they're readable.

## Make the Pull Request

Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation, make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the `repository`. Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request. Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these rules. If you are contributing for an issue, then please add the issue number in the comment while sending us a pull request.
